## Installation

- Get [ImMobile Latest](https://github.com/basharast/ImMobile/releases/latest) 
- Open `Addons`
- Click on `Online` tab
- Find & Install `ImmLibretro`

The extension will set it self for auto start after first launch

click on the bolt icon to start it, then go to `Library` and toggle the UI

on ImMobile next startup, you will see a shortcut on the Home grid for easy access

## Input

Supports multiple input (Touch/Keyboard/Gamepad) with easy to use mapping system

you can assign up to 5 players/ports

## Touch Controller

Highly advanced & customizable touch controller

it provide debug visualization so user can understand how adjust touch senstivity

## Core Manage

A lot of helper to simplify core's management, such as BIOS files

it's easy to know whether core require extra files or not

## Future

It's planned to support GL/GLES in future and port more cores

also I will try to find solutions to improve core's UWP compatiblity and speed

the UI can be improved for landscape mode, but currently it's ok

I would love to get this including ImMobile over XBOX but no demands for it 

and I have no idea how to test that without actual XBOX device.
