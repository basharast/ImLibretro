## Future

It's planned to support GL/GLES in future and port more cores

also I will try to find solutions to improve core's UWP compatiblity and speed

the UI can be improved for landscape mode, but currently it's ok

I would love to get this including ImMobile over XBOX but no demands for it 

and I have no idea how to test that without actual XBOX device.
